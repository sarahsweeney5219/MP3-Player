# MP3-Player
MP3 Player Implementation with ArrayList Project for CSC1052

#Project Task: 

In this project, you will implement your own version of an ArrayList and use it to
store Track objects that are songs played on an MP3 player.
You will be provided with a fully functional MP3 player that uses the Java libraryâ€™s ArrayList
class. Your task is to get the MP3 player running exactly as given to you using your own
implementation of an ArrayList.
The MP3Player.java file contains all code related to the GUI and playing of Mp3 files, as well as
a main class that will test your data structure. You do not modify this file. In fact, you do not
even need to understand all of the details of the Mp3Player.java file. 

#My Code Deliverables:

MyArrayList.java, MyIndexOutOfBoundsException.java
